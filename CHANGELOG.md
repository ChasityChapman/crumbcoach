### 7. Do Not Disturb Support
```typescript
// Features Added:
- Quiet hours detection (9 PM - 7 AM)
- In-app notification banners
- Mobile DND status indicators
- Alternative notification delivery
```

**New Component:** `in-app-notification-banner.tsx`
- Colored notification banners by type
- Action buttons for immediate response
- Priority indicators for important notifications

## üìä Comprehensive Timeline Analytics

### Event Tracking System
```typescript
// Events Implemented:
bake_start       // Recipe begins, timing starts
bake_complete    // Full bake finished with metrics
step_complete    // Step done with actual vs estimated time
step_skip        // Step bypassed with reason and impact
step_reopen      // Completed step revisited (future)
recalibrate_open // Recalibration sheet opened
recalibrate_apply // Timeline adjusted with mode/delta
notif_tap        // Notification responded to
notif_missed     // Opened >10 minutes late  
pause            // Timeline paused
resume           // Timeline resumed after pause
```

### Analytics Insights Available

**Recipe Optimization:**
- Steps with consistent timing drift (>10 min average)
- High skip rate steps (>20% skip rate)
- Frequently recalibrated recipes
- User completion patterns

**User Behavior:**
- Notification response times
- Recalibration frequency and patterns
- Pause/resume usage
- Step interaction patterns

**Data Storage:**
- **Local Persistence**: 1000 most recent events in localStorage
- **Export Ready**: JSON format for external analysis
- **Privacy Focused**: No data sent to external servers

### New File: `timeline-analytics.ts`
```typescript
// Key Features:
- Comprehensive event type definitions
- Local storage with automatic cleanup
- Recipe analysis with problematic step identification
- Bake analysis with completion metrics
- Export functionality for data analysis
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Microcopy Updates (Direct, Calm Tone)

### Before vs After

| Context | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Empty State** | "No active bakes. Start a new bake to begin your sourdough journey" | "No active bake. Start one to get a live timeline and reminders." |
| **Recalibration** | Complex technical explanation | "We'll shift your next steps by +12 min." |
| **Pause** | Generic pause message | "Timer paused. Fermentation doesn't care‚Äîset a reminder if you step away." |
| **Missed Step** | "Running Late? Missed [Step]? Recalibrate to keep timings useful." | "[Step] is overdue. Open to recalibrate your timeline." |
| **App Restore** | Technical restoration message | "Missed: [Step] (12m ago). Open to recalibrate your timeline." |

### New Components for Messaging:
- `recalibration-banner.tsx` - Delta minute display
- `pause-message.tsx` - Calm pause guidance
- Updated notification strings throughout `notifications.ts`
