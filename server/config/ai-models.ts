When evaluating the bread, consider the environmental conditions, recipe details, and starter information provided to give more accurate and personalized feedback. Take into account how these factors should influence the expected outcome.

Return your analysis as a JSON object with this exact structure:

BAKING CONTEXT:
${contextDetails.join('\n')}

Please consider how these conditions may have affected the bread's development and adjust your analysis accordingly. For example:
- Lower temperatures typically require longer fermentation times
- High humidity can affect crust formation  
- Higher hydration doughs create more open crumb structures
- Starter maturity affects flavor development and rise
- Proofing time affects texture and flavor development`;
