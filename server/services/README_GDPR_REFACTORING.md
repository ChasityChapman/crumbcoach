# GDPR Service Refactoring

## Overview

The original `GDPRService.ts` (800+ lines) has been refactored into multiple focused services to improve maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## New Service Architecture

### 1. **AuditService** (`auditService.ts`)
**Responsibility**: Audit logging and compliance tracking
- `logEvent()` - Log security and compliance events
- `getUserAuditTrail()` - Retrieve user's audit history
- `cleanupExpiredLogs()` - Remove old audit logs per retention policy
- `calculateRetentionDate()` - Calculate 7-year retention dates

### 2. **DataExportService** (`dataExportService.ts`)
**Responsibility**: GDPR Article 20 data portability compliance
- `exportUserData()` - Complete user data export in multiple formats
- Private methods for gathering different data categories:
  - `gatherPersonalData()` - User profile and subscription data
  - `gatherBakingData()` - Recipes, bakes, logs, photos
  - `gatherActivityData()` - Timeline steps, sensors, analytics
  - `gatherComplianceData()` - Audit trails and legal information
  - `calculateStatistics()` - Usage statistics

### 3. **DataDeletionService** (`dataDeletionService.ts`)
**Responsibility**: GDPR Article 17 right to erasure
- `requestDataDeletion()` - Initiate deletion request with email confirmation
- `confirmDataDeletion()` - Process confirmed deletion requests
- `performFullDeletion()` - Complete account and data removal
- `performAnonymization()` - Remove personal identifiers only
- `getDataSummary()` - Calculate deletion impact summary
- `cleanupExpiredRequests()` - Remove old deletion requests

### 4. **ComplianceService** (`complianceService.ts`)
**Responsibility**: Compliance reporting and validation
- `generateReport()` - Create comprehensive compliance reports
- `validateRetentionCompliance()` - Check account retention compliance
- `getRightsInformation()` - GDPR rights documentation
- `getLegalBasisInfo()` - Legal basis for data processing

### 5. **DataRetentionService** (`dataRetentionService.ts`)
**Responsibility**: Data retention policies and automated cleanup
- `runRetentionCleanup()` - Automated data cleanup based on policies
- `scanRetentionCompliance()` - Identify data approaching retention limits
- `validateRetention()` - Check specific data against policies
- `scheduleRetentionCleanup()` - Set up automated cleanup jobs
- `generateRetentionReport()` - Retention policy overview

### 6. **GDPRService** (`gdprService.ts`) - **Facade/Orchestrator**
**Responsibility**: Backwards compatibility and service coordination
- Maintains existing API for current code
- Delegates to specialized services
- Re-exports types for backward compatibility
- Provides high-level orchestration methods

## Benefits of Refactoring

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to understand and modify specific functionality
- Reduced coupling between different GDPR operations

### ✅ **Improved Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused files are easier to navigate and understand
- Bug fixes and features can be isolated to specific services
- Easier code reviews with focused changes

### ✅ **Enhanced Testability**
- Individual services can be unit tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies more easily for testing
- Better test coverage with focused test suites

### ✅ **Better Extensibility**
- New GDPR features can be added to appropriate services
- Services can be enhanced independently
- Easier to add new data retention policies or export formats

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing code continues to work unchanged
- Gradual migration path for consuming code
- No breaking changes to current API

## Migration Guide

### For New Code
```typescript
// Prefer direct service imports for new code
import { AuditService } from '../services/auditService';
import { DataExportService } from '../services/dataExportService';
import { DataDeletionService } from '../services/dataDeletionService';

// Use specific services directly
await AuditService.logEvent({
  userId,
  userEmail,
  action: 'login',
  category: 'auth',
  details: { source: 'web' }
});
```

### For Existing Code
```typescript
// Existing code continues to work
import GDPRService from '../services/gdprService';

// All existing methods still available
await GDPRService.logAuditEvent(userId, email, 'login', 'auth', details);
await GDPRService.exportUserData(userId, options);
```

### Gradual Migration
1. New features should use specific services directly
2. Existing code can be migrated incrementally
3. The `GDPRService` facade will remain for backward compatibility
4. Consider migrating high-traffic or frequently modified code first

## File Structure

```
server/services/
├── auditService.ts           # Audit logging and compliance tracking
├── dataExportService.ts      # Data portability and export
├── dataDeletionService.ts    # Data deletion and anonymization
├── complianceService.ts      # Compliance reporting and validation
├── dataRetentionService.ts   # Retention policies and cleanup
├── gdprService.ts           # Facade/orchestrator (refactored)
└── README_GDPR_REFACTORING.md # This documentation
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one aspect of GDPR compliance
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services can be easily mocked and tested
3. **Error Handling**: Isolated error handling per service domain
4. **Performance**: Smaller modules load faster and use less memory
5. **Documentation**: Each service is self-documenting with clear interfaces
6. **Extensibility**: New GDPR requirements can be added to appropriate services

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test suites for each service
2. **Monitoring**: Add service-specific metrics and logging
3. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation for each service
4. **Migration**: Gradually migrate existing code to use specific services
5. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize individual services as needed
